# Weight loss tracker app

Add your gains and losses along with the date to keep track of your weight loss journey

App built using React

# Installing react to use this app locally

Go to your terminal and cd into the directory you wish to install this app to

git clone this repo and in the terminal type npm install to get all of the dependencies

finally, type npm start and enjoy.

Feel free to make edits to this project, there will also be a version with a full backend coming soon, though that code will be private and hosted online for anyone to use the app itself.

# Usage

The weight is initialzed to 0, so you will want to set the current date and your current weight to get things started.

From there, you can select a date using the date picker and add a positive (weight gain) or negative (weight loss) number to adjust your weight in the tracker. It is recommended that you do this once a week for the best results!

- Please note: this version does not actually track your weight gains/losses over time unless it remains open which is not recommended. If you wish to have it keep track of your weight, feel free to build out your own backend for it, or check out the full version at this.site@isntupyet.com.

# Changes (to be made) as of 6/23

- Add Node backend and a DB for actual storage of data

- Add dark/light mode ??
