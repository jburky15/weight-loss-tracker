# Usage

The weight is initialzed to 0, so you will want to set the current date and your current weight to get things started.

From there, you can select a date using the date picker and add a positive (weight gain) or negative (weight loss) number to adjust your weight in the tracker. It is recommended that you do this once a week for the best results!
